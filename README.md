# The Movie Database with Next.js

This is a project that I am developing using Next.js, React, HTML, CSS, and Sass. It uses the Movie Database API.

This is an in progress project that I developed to test out Next.js. It may, or may not, end up being completed. If you would like to see something more finished, please take a look at one of my other repositories.
